#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Regan and Jonny paired together. It took about 1 hour**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started by adding the github API object keys that are returned from the api GET to the handlebars template on index.html.
  2. Next, we added additional scripts to the bottom of the page in order to render content.
  3. Third, we built the AJAX request to GET data from api.github.com.
